Converted `Stadler lab - Prashant`'s onenote section: `Protocols` into markdown using the obsidian community plugin: [importer](https://help.obsidian.md/import/onenote)

**Goal** is to upload onto github for future reference of Stadler lab folks ; *hopefully someone maintains it?*

# TODO
- [ ] Generate a TOC using this [github page](https://github.com/crankyMagician/toc_generator)
	- [ ] Or find a community plugin on obsidian?
- [x] Move all attachments into attachments/ folder, preserving hyperlinks within notes.  *happens automatically!* Try [this forum stuff](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/newbie-questions-attachments-how-to-deal-with-them/80461/7)

*Things to do before presenting this protocol to Stadler lab meeting on Dec 31st*
- [ ] Triage 1: Make for brevity, remove redundant protocols
- [ ] Triage 2 : Remove unnecessary attachments
- [ ] Publish on stadler-lab github page? *check that the size is not too bad < 50 MB~?*

## Observations on the convertor

- Tables: Tables containing shaded cells don't translate over as tables ; only the shading is focussed on with the ==highlight== syntax
