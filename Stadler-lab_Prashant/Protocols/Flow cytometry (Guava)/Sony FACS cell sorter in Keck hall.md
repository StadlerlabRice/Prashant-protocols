**Sony FACS** (Shyam notes)  
Machine: [SH800S Cell sorter](https://www.sonybiotechnology.com/us/instruments/sh800s-cell-sorter/specifications/);  
Pre-run

- Empty waste, add bleach
- Disconnect and depressurize sheath fluid tank, make sure filled 90%. Water for SA8300. Depressurize while closing again.
- Turn on air pump, let pressurize for a minute.
- Turn on machine, then software.
 
Starting

- Load chip following software. Sony at top. Very gently press it in slot.
- Can choose all lasers. Choose middle filter.
- During fluidics check, check that sample line is dripping.
    
    - Halfway into fluidics check, optionally do sheath filter debubble, following inductions. 
- Vortex existing tube of setup beads (purple). Or else vortex stock and aliquot 15 drops in a 5 mL tube and vortex again. Load in machine. 
- Select standard setup 
- Toward the middle of the calibration sort phase, prepare samples. 
 
Samples

- Choose lasers and fluorophores. 
- For more than one color, choose color compensation. (make sure to replace and refrigerate setup beads)
- Adjust fsc bsc and click restart, until negative ctrl population is in gated circle, and whole peak is each fluorophore is in gated rectangle. 
- Sample pressure max 6–7. 

Set stop conditions, e.g. gated event count,  
 10,000 in gate A (all events). Repeat with every fluorophore, whose peak should be a few log higher than its population in the negative ctrl.  
 Right click to plot histograms and set gates.  
Normal mode will be 95% pure.  
0 = infinity cells  
Droplet indicator should be green.  
500 μL medium in 5 mL tube.
 
Shutdown:

- Cytometer > Software & Hardware button for shutdown procedure. 10 min bleach, diH2O rinse. 
- Turn off the compressor
