Guava Flow cytometry @ Bennett lab training guidelines : David Zong

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020250102022524-0.jpeg)  

Cell counts should be between 100-500 cells per ul. Can OD the cultures and dilute appropriately

Guava SEA training  
24/11/20  
**Steps**

1. Empty the external waste vial, fill up the ICF fluid in the other vial;
    
    1. check for precipitates/clumps in the existing fluid and discard completely + rinse in water
2. Run Guava-clean cycle (once) - takes 15 mins
    
    1. Put a vial of DI water for capillary shutdown

**Spectral information**  
Guava easyCyte HT BG system is a flow cytometer for performing flow cytometry experiments.  
It is equipped with 2 lasers: Blue 488 nm (150 mW) and Green 532 nm (100mW) with 8 fluorescent detection channels, forward and side scatter.

Calibration beads

- Sony and Spherotech have the same values (in file : calibration_beads_sony.csv)
- Spherotech has only these 5 channels, and Sony has 9 listed in their data sheets

**Syto-17** cannot be excited with these lasers :(  
SYTO 17 is a fluorescent compound with an excitation peak at 619 nm and an emission peak at 638 nm

Comparison to Sony/BRC  
Guava can do 500 cells/ul x 0.59 ul/sec = 300 events/sec = 18,000 cells/min  
Sony can do 5,000 events/sec :: So if you need lots of events (> 20,000), better use the Sony
 
*Fill the capillary resting tube  
with water

1. Make sure cleaning fluid (ICF) is > 1/4th
    
    1. Empty the waste container

**Explanation of terms**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|(FSC) Forward scatter|<relative size, larger size => higher FSC> : FSC intensity is proportional to the diameter of the cell, and is primarily due to light diffraction around the cell.<br><br>> From <[flowjo](http://flowjo.com/learn/flowjo-university/flowjo/before-flowjo/58)>|
|(SSC) Side scatter|Side scatter measurement provides information about the internal complexity (i.e. granularity) of a cell. The interface between the laser and intracellular structures causes the light to refract or reflect. Cellular components that increase side scatter include granules and the nucleus (1).Â <br><br>> From <[https://www.flowjo.com/learn/flowjo-university/flowjo/before-flowjo/58](https://www.flowjo.com/learn/flowjo-university/flowjo/before-flowjo/58)>|
|Backscatter|In some machines, backscatter is used in the place of SSC|
