|Purpose|Tested this instrument Sony SA3800 since SEA/Guava in keck is not working now - 17/3/22<br><br>- New location - ==BRC 213==<br>- Old/In BRC 840, tabor lab|
|Manuals|Sony SA3800 : Operators guide in the folder at : _LE-SA3800_Operators_Guide_EN_Rev04.pdf_<br><br>- [Spectral unmixing note](https://www.sonybiotechnology.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sony_Spectral-Unmixing-TB.pdf) : WLSM uses weighted least square method to identify noise and the summation of spectra of the individual fluorophores. Brighter channels are underweighted..|
|Details|Instrument is more forgiving of cell concentration but needs to be diluted ~ 50x - 100x<br><br>- single strain controls - .5 x 10 = 5x, on the higher end<br>- Old cultures : .2 x 100 = 20x - on the higher end too?<br><br>28/3/22 - did dilution : .4 * 100 -- conclusion?|
|Instrument settings|- Threshold : SSC : 0.1% (changed from the default FSC in [S048](S048*%20(S,%20An)%20-%20E%20coli%20RAM%20dilutions))<br>- Gains<br>- Fl gain : 55 (also reduced from 64 in S048?)|

Notes  
Use templates for each group to save the gains + gating and event counts. Write the name in the notebook for future use
