3.3. Preparation of frozen cells for electro-transfor- mation

- ~~50 mls of~~ LB was inoculated with a single colony of OT684 and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm.
- An aliquot (0.2 ml) of this culture was added to **250 mls of LB** and **grown for 4-5 h (A650 - 0.7) at 37°C** with shaking at **200 rpm**.
- The cells were then chilled on ice (15 min) and centrifuged at 3500 x g for 10 min at 4oC.
- The pellet was gently resuspended, with a 10 ml pipette, in 100 ml of ice cold **15% (w/v) glycerol** and centrifuged as before.
- The wash was repeated twice and the final pellet was **resuspended with 2.0 ml** of the appropriate ~ee-cold solution. (~ 100 fold concentration)
- Aliquots were dispensed into pre-chilied micro-centrifuge tubes and stored at - 70°C
 
3.4. Electro-transformation of cells

- Tubes of frozen cells were thawed on ice for 20 mins and 40 ul of their contents were added to cold micro-centrifuge tubes containing plasmid DNA (40 pg-300 ng) dissolved in 5ull of TE (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, ~ mM E )TA) buffer or water.
- After an **incubation period of 0-60 min on ice** in pre-chilled Potter type disposable cuvettes (0.2 cm gap; BioRad Labc':atories, Richmond, CA)
- the cells were subjected to electroporation at 1.25 kV (higher might be better, not tested)
- im- mediately after delivery of the pulse **955 uL** of room-temperature **Lb, supplemented with 20 mM MgCl 2**, was added to the cell suspension without mixing.
- The cells were allowed to recover for one minute before being transferred to a 16 × 150 mm test tube containin **4 ml** of prewarmed (37 o C) LB. After 1 h incubation on a Roto-Torque cell roller (Cole Parmer, Chicago IL) at 80 rpm
- the cells were plated on LB agar supplemented with 250 ug/ml carbenicillin. Viable cell counts were determined before and after electroporation by plating on LB agar.
- Colonies were counted after 18-24 h incubation at **37°C**.
