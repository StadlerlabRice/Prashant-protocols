1. Culture Vnat and Vmax overnight in BHI + V2.
2. Chill electroporation buffer and centrifuge bottles and rotor in 4°C.

Electroporation buffer pH = 7

==Salt== ==Concentration required== ==Molecular weight== ==Amount required for 1L==
|Sucrose|680 mM|342.3 g/mol|232.76 g|
|K2HPO4|7 mM|174.2 g/mol|1.22 g|
 6. Inoculate BHI + V2 salts 1:200 with overnight culture.
7. Grow culture at 37oC, 250 rpm, until OD600 = 0.5.
8. Chill cells on ice for 15 min.
9. Transfer to sterile centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 4C at 5000g for 10 min.
10. Decant the supernatant.
11. Resuspend cell pellet in 50-60 mL electroporation buffer and centrifuge at 4C at 5000g for 10 min.
12. Repeat step 8 x 3 times.
13. Resuspend the final pellet in ~100 uL of electroporation buffer (final OD~16, final dilution is 1:500).
14. Aliquot into 50 uL tubes and flash freeze. 
Electroporation protocol
 18. Thaw competent cells on ice.
19. Add 1-10 µL DNA (need experimental verification of amount; start with 1 µL of 10-50 ng/µL).
20. Flick mix gently and transfer to 1 mm electroporation cuvette.
21. Electroporate at 0.9 kV (need to set this manually; hold down the settings button till it goes to manual mode).
22. Immediately resuspend cells in 500 µL BHI(V2?) media.
23. Transfer to centrifuge or culture tube and recover at 37C, 250 rpm shaking for 1 h.
24. Plate on selective antibiotic plate and incubate at 37C for quick growth, 30 oC for overnight.
      

Emm Fulk has tried the above protocol for both Vmax and Vnat type E (same preparation method) with successful transformation of ~30 ng of plasmid DNA.
