1. Inoculate **500mL** of L-broth with 1/100 volume of a fresh overnight E. coli culture
2. Grow the cells @ 37C shaking @ 300RPM to an ==OD600== of approximately ==0.5-0.7== (~ 3.5 hrs)
3. Chill cells on ice for ~20min. For all subsequent steps, keep the cells as close to 4C as possible and chill all containers in ice before adding cells. To harvest, transfer the cells to a cold centrifuge bottle and spin @ 4000 x g for 15min @ 4C
4. Carefully pour off and discard the supernatant. It is better to sacrifice yield by pouring off a few cells than to leave any supernatant behind
5. Gently resuspend the pellet in 500mL of ice-cold **10% glycerol**. Centrifuge @ 4000 x g for 15min @ 4C; carefully pour off supernatant
6. Resuspend the pellet in 250mL of ice-cold 10% glycerol. Centrifuge @ 4000 x g for 15min @ 4c; carefully pour off supernatant
7. Resuspend pellet in ~20mL of ice-cold 10% glycerol. Transfer to a 30 mL sterile Oakridge tube. Centrifuge @ 400 x g for 15min @ 4C; carefully pour off supernatant
8. Resuspend the cell pellet in a **final volume of 1-2 mL** of ice-cold 10% glycerol. The cell concentration should be about 1-3 x 1010 cells/mL 
This suspension may be frozen in aliquots on dry ice and stored @ -70C. The cells are stable for at least 6 months under these conditions

Got 10^11 efficiency CFU/ug; Should work in NEB Turbo  
Since NEB Turbo is TG1 Δ==endA== (endonuclease), you ought to get similar results with it. They got a whopping 10¹¹ CFU/µg pUC19 efficiency. 

- Grow overnight 10 hr
- Subculture - capture at OD : 0.45
    
    - Use Lots of aireation flask - 400 ml / 2 l flask
- 2 hr recovery

Variations:

- OD600reaches 0.35-0.4
- centrifugation at 1000g(~2400 rpmin the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 20 minutes
- Resuspend each pellet in 1 mL of ice cold 10%glycerol by gently swirling. The final OD600of the resuspended cells should be ~200-250

Josh does 500 ml to 2 ml concentrate now a days

- 6 part golden gates seem to work routinely
   

Principle

- Electroporation requires cells to be in a non-conducting medium, hence the salts from growth media must be removed by 4-5 washes
    
    - Might need more washes for marine organisms growing in higher salts such as Vibrio natriegens
    - It might be beneficial to grow in a lower salt medium, such as SOB as opposed to LB
