Please note, we are working on updating the ARTIC protocol with Kit V14 and will keep you informed of the progress.  
The discontinuation process will follow these three steps: 

1. Products being discontinued will be moved from our main store page to the store **Legacy tab** on the February 8th, but they will still be available to order via the store
2. With six weeks' notice, products will be removed from the Legacy tab and only available **through a request to Customer Service**
3. Depending on stock level, and with six weeks' notice, products will be discontinued **between September and December 2023** – exact dates will be confirmed via email

If you order kits on behalf of others, or as part of a group, we kindly ask you to forward this email onto the appropriate people.
