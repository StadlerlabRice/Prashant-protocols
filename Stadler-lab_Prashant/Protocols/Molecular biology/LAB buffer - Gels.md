|---|---|
|pH|Check pH to make sure that it is **< 6.5**<br><br>  <br><br>(A pH around 6.5 in the 50x stock will result in pH 7.5 in the final solution (which you should not exceed))  <br>10.2, 6.2|
|Voltage|Run the gel at 15-20 V/cm (possibly higher) for 15-20 minutes (it's good to set a timer)  <br>- For small gels (silberg lab) use 150V for 15 mins for 1% gel ; 10 cm inter-electrode spacing<br><br>- Still trying to fix the poor "smiley" ladder (11/12/20 )|

**Examples**  
I typically run my gels at about 30 V/cm for 20 â€“ 30 minutes. As you can see in this picture of a 1% gel made in LAB + GelRed, even the high molecular weight bands are pretty well resolved.

Separation of bands in 1% agarose gel made using LAB buffer. I used the 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder (Invitrogen) here.
