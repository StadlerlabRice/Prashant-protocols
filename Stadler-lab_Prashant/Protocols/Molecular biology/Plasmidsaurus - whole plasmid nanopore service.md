Other type of tubes (1.5 mL, 0.5 mL, 384-well format, opaque, etc.) are not compatible with our rapid workflow.<br><br>  <br>> From <[https://www.plasmidsaurus.com/confirm/6998209778955778897/](https://www.plasmidsaurus.com/confirm/6998209778955778897/)>|
|Steps for analysis|1. Look at the size distribution **.png** images - for concatemers with 2x, 3x, 4x sizes<br>2. Check pLannotate for quick glance<br>3. Align the consensus **.gbk** file to benchling (get annotations for free!) -- make adjustments to get the ends to work<br>4. Download the raw reads and play with it .. Write the mapping/alignment tools here once figured out|
