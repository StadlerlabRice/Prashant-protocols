To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for min or apply vacuum to the manifold until all the samples have passed through the column. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. For sample volumes >800 PI, load and spin/apply vacuum again. 6. If DNA will subsequently be used for sequencing, in vitro transcription, or microinjection, add 500 pl Buffer QC to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for I min or apply vacuum.

**Pre-knowledge**  
[Bennettlab/Agarose gel electrophoresis](https://wiki.rice.edu/confluence/display/BIODESIGN/DNA+Agarose+Gel+Electrophoresis)
 
**Ideal protocol:**

1. Cut gel, weigh and add 3 volumes of Zymo ADB Buffer* (~~QX1 buffer~~: old) (1 g gel = 1 ml)
    
    1. Heat at 42 - 55oC, until gel dissolves (< 10 min)
2. (extra steps) Put tube on ice - 5 min -- _enhances precipitation and improves recovery_
    
    1. Add isopropanol (1 volume)
    2. Vortex or invert to mix
3. Optional : Add 1 volume of water
    
    1. Good for longer products : >= 5 kb
4. Add to the small spin column, centrifuge (spin 30 sec, 16,000 x g after every step)
5. Wash - 2x with 200 ul wash buffer
6. Dry spin for 2 mins
7. Elute with water or ==Elution buffer== into a fresh 1.5 ml tube (2 elutions with 6 ul each = 12 ul)
    
    1. Heat your elution buffer to 65oC prior to elution
8. Wait for 5 mins
9. Spin and catch the elution buffer with DNA
10. Quantify on a nanodrop and optionally run a gel

*Reasoning

- QX1 buffer does not contain Guanidinium salts, so the final DNA product is free of Guanidinium contamination
    
    - Recently QX1 has been acting up so Shyam recommends ADB form Zymo
