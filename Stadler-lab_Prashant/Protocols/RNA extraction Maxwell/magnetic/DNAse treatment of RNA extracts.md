|Goal|I want to degrade the DNA right after RNA extraction using the maxwell robot. But I would like to avoid further purification (if possible) by a safe form of heat treatment that does not interfere with downstream steps - RT and qPCR|
|[Turbo DNAse](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AM2238#/AM2238)|Turbo page recommends a phenol chloroform extraction, or adding EDTA and 75C inactivation step (EDTA could interfere with RT??)<br><br>  <br><br>Turbo costs : 125$/250 rxns (2 ul/rxn = 4 U/rxn)|
|Cheaper DNAses|Could add 10x of the DNAse into the lysate CTAB to enhance digestion? Good to look for a cheaper source of the enzyme in this case..<br><br>  <br><br>[DNAse I](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/EN0521#/EN0521) (less efficient I guess) - 68$ / 250 rxns -- this is less concentrated, so use 4 ul / rxn  <br>[Promega RQ1](https://www.promega.com/products/cloning-and-dna-markers/molecular-biology-enzymes-and-reagents/rq1-rnase_free-dnase/?catNum=M6101) : 54$ / 1,000 units :|
|Turbo [DNAse free kit](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AM1907#/AM1907)|Has an additional inactivating reagent for inactivating the DNAse;  <br>Is this better than just plain EDTA? Yes! Looks like it is precipitating the DNAse along with the divalent ions rather than heat inactivating.  <br>Costs : 133$/ 50 rxns (10x more than the DNAse itself; still cheaper than the 338$ maxwell kit for 48 rxns)  <br>[Manual](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/1907M_turbodnafree_UG.pdf) :|
|Zymo cleanup columns|After using plain Turbo DNAse (25$/ 50rxn), this can be used<br><br>  <br><br>[Zymo](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/rna-clean-concentrator-kits-rcc/products/rna-clean-concentrator-25) RNA clean, concentrator -25/50 : $142/50 rxn<br><br>- Cost comparable to DNAse free, will have no inhibition - maybe some loss (~ 10%) due to the columns (which could be more than the magnetic beads..?)<br>- Hands-on time of 10-15 mins<br><br>  <br><br>Side note: Is liquid DNAse digestion more efficient than in column DNAse digestion on Zymo?|
