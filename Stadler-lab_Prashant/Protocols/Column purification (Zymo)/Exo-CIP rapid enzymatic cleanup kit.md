Remove primers and dNTPs in 5 mins ; polymerase is still around - might it mess with sanger sequencing?

- Genewiz has a field to designate for enzymatic cleanup so it should be ok?

Protocol at [NEB](https://www.neb.com/en-us/protocols/2019/01/16/protocol-for-exo-ciprapid-pcr-cleanup-e1050)

- 5 ul PCR product + 1 ul Exo-CIP A + 1 ul Exo-CIP B
- 37C, 4 m; 80C, 1 m
 
How much to submit for Sanger/genewiz?

- NEB says submit 3 ul or less.. Seems to be plenty from one example [imageJ quantification](Gel%20quantification%20with%20ImageJ) of gel

**Question:**  
Have you validated the exo-Cip rapid cleanup kit for gibson or golden gate assemblies? It wasn't listed in the downstream applications under this page: E1050S
 
Product SKU: E1050S
 
**Answer:**  
Dear Dr. Kalvapalle,
 
Thank you for contacting us with this question.  No.  We have not tried this.  A cleanup step in between to get rid of the proteins may be the best apporach.
 
I hope that this information is helpful.
 
Sincerely,
