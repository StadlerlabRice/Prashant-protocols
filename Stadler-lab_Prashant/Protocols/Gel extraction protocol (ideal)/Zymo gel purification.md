Protocol  
Buffer Preparation  
✓ Before starting: Add 24 ml 100% ethanol (26 ml 95% ethanol) to the 6  
ml DNA Wash Buffer concentrate. Add 96 ml 100% ethanol (104 ml  
95% ethanol) to the 24 ml DNA Wash Buffer concentrate.  
✓ DNA Wash Buffer included with D4001S and D4001T is supplied  
ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol prior to use.
 
Sample Processing  
All centrifugation steps should be performed between 10,000 - 16,000 x g.

1. Excise the DNA fragment1 from the agarose gel using a razor blade,

scalpel or other device and transfer it into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge  
tube.

1. Add **3 volumes of ADB** to each volume of agarose excised from the

gel (e.g. for 100 μl (mg) of agarose gel slice add 300 μl of ADB).

1. Incubate at 55 °C2 for a minimum of 10 minutes3 and then briefly mix

the sample by vortexing or inverting. For optimal performance, it is  
essential that the gel slice is completely dissolved before moving on  
to step 4.  
For DNA fragments > 8 kb, following the incubation step, add one additional volume  
(equal to that of the gel slice) of water to the mixture for better DNA recovery (e.g., 100  
μl agarose, 300 μl ADB, and 100 μl water).

1. Transfer the melted agarose solution to a Zymo-Spin™ Column in a

Collection Tube.

1. Centrifuge for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through4.
2. Add 200 μl of DNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 30

seconds. Discard the flow-through. Repeat the wash step.  
1 The amount of agarose excised from the gel should be as small as possible.  
2 _Do not incubate above 60 °C._  
3 The incubation time will vary depending on the percentage of agarose and mass of the gel slice. This step can  
be performed at 37 °C but will require longer incubation to completely dissolve the agarose.  
4 Remove the flow-through by aspiration. Avoid contamination of the collection tube rim.  
6

1. Add ≥ 6 μl DNA Elution Buffer4 or water5 directly to the column matrix.

Place column into a 1.5 ml tube and centrifuge for 1 minute to elute  
DNA.  
Ultra-pure DNA is now ready for use.  
4 DNA Elution Buffer: 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1mM EDTA.  
5 Elution of DNA from the column is dependent on pH and temperature. If water is used, make sure the pH is  
>6.0. Waiting 1 minute prior to elution may improve the yield of larger (> 6 kb) DNA. For even larger DNA  
(> 10 kb), the total yield may be improved by eluting the DNA with 60-70°C DNA Elution Buffer
