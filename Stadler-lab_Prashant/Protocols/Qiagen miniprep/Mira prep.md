- I added the extra spin step - it is extremely difficult to handle the whole lysate, and there's a lot of debris that comes along even after the 10 min spin, hence it might be worthwhile to give 2 spins
 
- Caveat - There seems to be RNA contamination (hazy bands at low MW) (Did I add the RNAse A fresh?)
