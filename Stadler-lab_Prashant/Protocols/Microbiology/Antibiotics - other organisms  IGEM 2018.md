**Figure 2: Identification of inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics for the bacteria used in the project.** Growth of most strains is inhibited at 50 mg/L kanamycin. The growth of _S. meliloti_ is inhibited at 50 mg/L neomycin and _B. subtilis_ requires either >100 mg/L neomycin or >200 mg/L kanamycin to prevent growth.

Text :  
In order to identify the antibiotic concentrations to be used for selection with our strains, we performed titrations with neomycin and kanamycin by **spotting cultures on LB agar plates with concentrations** ranging from 0 to 200 mg/L. The results show that most strains can be inhibited with < 50 mg/L of kanamycin (Figure 2). The exceptions are _S. meliloti_ which is resistant to kanamycin but can be inhibited with neomycin and _B. subtilis_, whose growth can be inhibited at 200 mg/L kanamycin or 100 ng/mL kanamycin. We conclude that **KanR aph(3â€²)-II** can be used as a broad host range antibiotic resistance cassette in our constructs since it is known to confer resistance to both neomycin and kanamycin.
