"Transforming DNA did not need to be purified by gel extraction or PCR clean up kit before direct addition to the Acinetobacter ADP1 culture, and as little as 25 ng of transforming DNA added to the 1 ml of culture was sufficient to obtain transformants. After the 3 h, 150 Î¼l of the medium was plated on the appropriate selective plate"
