Context: I got a yeast from Bashor lab/Ronan to use for homologous recombination into large plasmids
 
Strain: [BY4741](https://www.yeastgenome.org/strain/by4741) ; background : [Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C (baker's yeast)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=559292&lvl=3&lin=f&keep=1&srchmode=1&unlock)

> From <[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000146045.2/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000146045.2/)>  

Plasmid: pRS315 (Leu2 plasmid with a CEN origin)
 
**Notes**:  
_We have YPH500, BY4741, and VL6-48 yeast strains in the lab currently. I had to streak them out to make sure our stocks were good but they are growing well so I can hand any or all of them over to you whenever is convenient. If you are just starting yeast assemblies and have complete freedom over what selection markers to use I would recommend working with_ _BY4741 as it grows very quickly and is well characterized - BY is compatible with Leu, His, and Ura selection__. YPH500 will offer greater flexibility over which markers you have access to though - it is compatible with Trp, Leu, His, and Ura. Please let me know if we can help streak you a plate or anything. Sorry again for taking so long to get back to you! - Ronan,_ 9/6/22 12:31 am
   

**Protocols**:  
Glycerol stock [protocol](https://openwetware.org/wiki/McClean:_Glycerol_stocks_(yeast)) : 15% final glycerol (we use 25% final for E coli, which might be ok for yeast too..)

- For e coli : The optimal concentration of long-term glycerol storage is unknown. Most labs store bacteria in 15-25% glycerol. - <[Addgene](https://www.addgene.org/protocols/create-glycerol-stock/)>

Media: YPD media, see media section
 
Selection media : Bennett lab has old dropout mixes - check if Leu is there ; Else Ronan offered from their lab as well
