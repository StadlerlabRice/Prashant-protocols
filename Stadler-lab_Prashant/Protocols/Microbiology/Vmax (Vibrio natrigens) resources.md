Hello Prashant,  
   
Thank you for inquiring about our Vmax X2 product.  The genotype is  dns::LacI-T7-RNAP  
and additional information can be found here: [https://codexdna.com/wp-content/themes/codexdna/assets/pdfs/Vmax-X2-User-Guide.pdf](https://codexdna.com/wp-content/themes/codexdna/assets/pdfs/Vmax-X2-User-Guide.pdf)  
   
The dns knockout has been engineered in this strain but not the catalase knock-in for improved cold stability/storage of agar plates at 4C.  
   
Please let us know if you have any further questions.  
Regards,  
**Julie Kuykendall**

Hi Dr. Kalvapalle-  
   
By way of this email, I want to introduce myself. I received your inquiry regarding our Vmax product. Genotype for the Vmax X2 cells is Vibrio natriegens 14048 dns::Lacl-T7-RNAP (can’t provide further details or than this). GG works fine in Vmax and does have the Dns KO, but not the catalase KI. We would recommend using the cloning strain because it has a RecA knock-out (although we haven't seen evidence of much recombination happening in X2 cells).  
   
I hope this helps. Vmax is available on our website portal. All that is required is registration. You can purchase using a credit card as well by calling or sending a request @CodexDNA ORDERS.  
   
Kind regards,  
   
Christopher
   

Thoughts - need to knockout recA myself for making a good cloning strain
