**Figure 3: determining function of pBBR1, RSF1010, and pWV01 origins of replication in different bacteria.** Transformation results demonstrate that plasmids containing either pBBR1 or RSF1010 are able to replicate in _E. coli_ strains, _P. putida_, and _S. oneidensis_, but not _A. baylyi_, and pWV01 fails to replicate in _S. oneidensis_.

Growth in Kan 25 (<=) works better for RSF1010 - Kshitij -> Shyam
 
Origins present in the lab
 
- Zach:Â gram positive origins I have are actually pBP1, pCB102, pCD6, and pIM13 if you ever need any of those
