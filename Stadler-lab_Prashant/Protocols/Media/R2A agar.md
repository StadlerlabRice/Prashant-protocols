**R2A agar** (**Reasoner's 2A agar**) is a [culture medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_medium)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2A_agar#cite_note-pmid10528669-1) developed to study [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria) which normally inhabit [potable water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potable_water).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2A_agar#cite_note-2) These bacteria tend to be slow-growing species and would quickly be suppressed by faster-growing species on a richer culture medium.  
Since its development in 1985,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2A_agar#cite_note-pmid42349-3) it has been found to allow the culturing of many other bacteria that will not readily grow on fuller, complex organic media.
