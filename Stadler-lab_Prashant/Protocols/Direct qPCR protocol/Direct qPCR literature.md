Omitting the preliminary DNA extraction step (direct PCR, or direct qPCR) significantly improved the workflow and sensitivity of the assay. An earlier study utilizing direct qPCR was conducted by Makino, Cheun, Watarai, Uchida, and Takeshi ([2001](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.rice.edu/doi/full/10.1111/efp.12509#efp12509-bib-0016)) who lysed anthrax (_Bacillus anthracis_) spores from air samples by a single heating step, using lysate as the template for qPCR. In 2016, it was reported using other prokaryotic cells (_Cronobacter muytjensii_) that direct qPCR could increase the analytical sensitivity of an assay by three orders of magnitude to >2 cells per ml (Soejima, Xiao, & Abe, [2016](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.rice.edu/doi/full/10.1111/efp.12509#efp12509-bib-0030)). For fungi, direct PCR has been used for diagnostics of fungal keratitis in humans (Zhao, Zhai, et al., [2014](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.rice.edu/doi/full/10.1111/efp.12509#efp12509-bib-0036)).
