**Copy Number Determination qPCR**  
Lysate standard sample qPCR

1. Inoculate a single colony into 5 mL of liquid LB medium with corresponding antibiotic and incubate in the shaker at 37oC.
2. After 14-16 h of growth, transfer 100 μL of suspended cells to fresh 5 mL of liquid LB medium with corresponding antibiotic and incubate at 37oC untill the OD600 reaches 0.7-0.8.
3. Spin down a suspended 1 mL of cells of 0.7 OD600 at 8.0g for 15 min.

(Growth conditions are specified at the end of the protocol).

5. Remove the medium and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of PBS.
6. Spin down the suspended of cells at 8.0g for 15 min.
7. Repeat steps 2 and 3.
8. Completely remove PBS from the cell pellet.
9. Incubate cells at 95o C for 10 min. ==<dry pellet is boiled and cooled>==
10. Store cells at -20o C for 10 min.
11. Completely resuspend dry cell pellet in 100 μL of water by pipetting. Then vortex for 30s and spin down.
12. Make an initial dilution by transferring 10 μL of resuspended cell to 40 μL of water. Pipet carefully vortex for 30s and spin down.
13. Make a second dilution by transferring 10 μL of to 90 μL of water. Pipet carefully vortex for 30s and spin down.==<Net dilution: 5 fold>==
14. For X reactions, make two different mixes using chromosome gene and plasmid gene primers:

X*6 μL of water  
X*1 μL Forward primer 20uM  
X*1 μL Reverse primer 20uM  
X*10 μL of SYBR Green

16. First, transfer 18 μL of mix with chromosome primers to first X tubes, then transfer 18 μL of plasmid primers mix to other X tubes (X*2 tubes)
17. Add 2 μL of each diluted sample to the tubes.
18. Gently close the caps.
19. Run the reaction.

For steps 13-15, increase the volumes by a factor of desired technical replicate numbers.
