- _Sinorhizobium meliloti_ strains were grown at 30°C in **LBmc** medium (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl, 0.301 g **MgSO****4**, and 0.277 g anhydrous CaCl2 were dissolved in sddH2O to a final volume of 1 L, and then autoclaved. Solid plates contained 1.5% agar.) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics (streptomycin (100 μg mL-1), spectinomycin (200 μg mL-1), gentamicin (40 μg mL-1), tetracycline (5 μg mL-1), neomycin (100 μg mL-1)), and 38 μM FeCl3 and/or 2 μM CoCl2, when appropriate.
