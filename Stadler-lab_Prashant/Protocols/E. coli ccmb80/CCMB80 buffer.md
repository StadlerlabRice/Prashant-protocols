50 ml CCMB is good for 7 preps of 50 ml cultures (5 ml + 2 ml per prep)  
pH 6.58 -> 6.4 takes 33 ul of 0.1N HCl. Previous attempt I used a plastic dropper and 1 drop went too far. After overshooting, till 6.15, 66 ul of 0.1M KOH brings it to around 6.4 again

pH adjustment to 6.4 prevents MnO2 precipitation. During storage, the pH of the solution drifts down to a final value of 6.1–6.2 but then stabilizes. During prolonged storage, a faint precipitate of a tan-colored substance may appear, but does not seem to affect the efficiency of transformation
