**For Setting up the Run**

2. (Opt.) Set water bath temp
3. Put samples in the autosampler tray and note the numbers
    
    1. Leave 1 empty vial for the column baking/regeneration protocol
4. Open the software - Mass hunter?
5. Click on Edit sequence button or click on sequence -> edit sequence, do the sequence editing: 
    
    1. Name and data file name should be the same
        
        1. Make a new directory inside your master directory and name it with experiment and date
    2. Vial is just the respective number on the autosampler tray 
    3. Method: Type = "sample" 
    4. Method : Choose Ilennes' Br,Cl, etc. V2 protocol
    5. Make the last entry the empty vial and make the method : Poraplot Bake..?
6. Go to run sequence
    
    1. Locate your folder
7. Press 'Run sequence' 
**For Obtaining Result/Quantitative Data**   
click the file below, GCMS quant.....   
open new batch, add the file folder, which is data short cut, Daniel, 2016sadfssadfds whatever the date.   
choose the method, which is... you should know this, sth sth septerpber... 5? sth.... 2015..? sth....   
and you do something, and run it,   
click exit.   
and you get the data.   
choose from above somewhere, to view only one specific molecule. MeBr. not 13.   
manually quantitate by clicking manual quantitation button, and dragging the portion to integrate.   
Click export, then save in your file in on the desktop, called Daniel.   
also save the batch, which will allow you to come back to it through data shortcut, Daniel.
